Scripts that I use to automate routine tasks

##updatefirefox.sh##
I run Debian but need Firefox(love the sync feature). 

	sudo ./updatefirefox.sh ../tars/firefox-X.X.tar.bz2
##fetch_sed.py##
A python script I used to scrap images from a website which had SED graphs. Needs Selenium plugin for your browser as well as the python lib.

Can be used when you need to fetch loads of images off a site where you can't download the images, and have to take a screenshot instead
